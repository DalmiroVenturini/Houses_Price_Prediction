# King County House Sales Analysis

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing house sale prices in King County, including Seattle, over a one-year period from May 2014 to May 2015. The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis including data loading, visualization, return calculations, and portfolio analysis tailored to the real estate sector. This project not only aims to strengthen my Python skills but also deepens my understanding of real estate financial data and enhances my analytical capabilities.
