# Houses_Price_Prediction
King County House Sales Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing house sale prices in King County, including Seattle, over a one-year period from May 2014 to May 2015. The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis including data loading, visualization, return calculations, and portfolio analysis tailored to the real estate sector. This project not only aims to strengthen your Python skills but also deepens your understanding of real estate financial data and enhances your analytical capabilities.

Setup
The project will be completed in teams, with different components of the analysis tackled over three days. It is designed to simulate real-world real estate analysis scenarios, fostering collaborative problem-solving and practical application of Python in real estate finance.

Dataset
The dataset contains one year of house sale prices across King County, providing a detailed view of the real estate market with 21 columns, including:

id: Unique identifier for each house.
date: Date of sale.
price: Sale price of the house (prediction target).
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms per bedroom.
sqft_living: Square footage of the interior living space.

sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.
yr_built: Year the house was built.
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated.
zipcode: ZIP code area.
lat: Latitude coordinate.
long: Longitude coordinate.
sqft_living15: Interior living space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
sqft_lot15: Land space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
TARGET â†’ Price: The main objective is to understand which features significantly impact the house price. Additionally, we aim to explore properties valued at $650,000 and above for more detailed insights.

Project Objectives
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
Feature Analysis: Determine key features that impact house sale prices.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate market trends and relationships.
Portfolio Analysis: Evaluate returns and risks associated with high-value properties (>$650K).
Collaboration
This project is structured for teamwork. Over three days, each team member will tackle different components of the analysis, sharing insights to build a comprehensive understanding of the King County real estate market.
